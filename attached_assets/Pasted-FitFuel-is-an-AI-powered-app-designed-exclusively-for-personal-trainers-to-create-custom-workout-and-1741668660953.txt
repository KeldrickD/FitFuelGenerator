FitFuel is an AI-powered app designed exclusively for personal trainers to create custom workout and meal plans that power their clients’ wins—fast, affordable, and branded. With a few taps, trainers input a client’s goals, fitness level, diet preferences, training days, and weekly food budget, and FitFuel delivers dual plans that evolve, adapt, and impress.
Core Features:
Workout Plans: Tailored exercises (e.g., “2x10 squats”) that progress weekly (e.g., “3x12 next week”) based on fitness level and goals like weight loss or muscle gain.  

Meal Plans: Budget-friendly meals (e.g., “$2 tofu lunch”) aligned with diet prefs (vegan, high protein) and seasonal food costs (e.g., summer berries).  

Budget Smarts: Keeps meals under a set weekly spend (e.g., $40/week = $5.70/day).
Standout Enhancements:
Progression Booster: Workouts auto-adjust to keep clients advancing.  

Seasonal Meal Swap: Substitutes ingredients for cost and availability (e.g., tomatoes in July).  

Quick Substitution Tool: Swaps meals or exercises on the fly (e.g., “tofu → lentils”).  

Client Motivation Blurbs: Adds pep talks (e.g., “You’re crushing it!”) to plans.  

Trainer Branding Option: Outputs plans with the trainer’s logo/name (e.g., “Coach Mike’s Plan”).
How It Works:
Trainer enters client details (e.g., “Jane, lose weight, beginner, vegan, $40/week”).  

AI generates a branded PDF: workouts that scale, meals that fit the budget, swaps if needed, and motivational boosts.  

Trainer delivers a pro-level plan in minutes—not hours.
